# Java OOPs Concepts

This repository demonstrates the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** in Java with simple and clear examples. It's designed for beginners and students who want to understand OOPs practically.

## 📘 What is OOPs in Java?

Object-Oriented Programming is a method of structuring a program using objects and classes. Java is a fully object-oriented language that supports all four major OOPs principles:

* **Encapsulation**
* **Inheritance**
* **Polymorphism**
* **Abstraction**

## 🧱 Core Concepts Explained

### 1. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the practice of keeping fields private and providing access through public methods. It protects data and improves code security.

> Example: `Student.java` - Demonstrates private fields with getters and setters.

### 2. Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit properties and behavior from another class (parent).

> Example: `Animal.java` and `Dog.java` - Shows how a child class can extend a parent class.

### 3. Polymorphism

Polymorphism means one thing can take many forms, such as method overloading and overriding.

> Example: `Shape.java` and `Circle.java` - Demonstrates runtime and compile-time polymorphism.

### 4. Abstraction

Abstraction hides internal details and shows only the necessary parts through abstract classes or interfaces.

> Example: `Vehicle.java` (abstract class) and `Car.java` (implementation).
