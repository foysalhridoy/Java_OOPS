# Java_OOPS
Java OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System) is a programming model that uses objects to design applications. It helps structure code using classes, objects, and key concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism. This makes code more reusable, maintainable, and easier to understand.
